### What I learned

I learn the basics of responsive website which indicates the mobile view first and he use of media queries. Although it's challenging, but I find it enjoyable to code and see your final output. I also learn some CSS grid basic eventhough I didn't use it on this challenge. 


I'm proud that I've learn this codes in this challenge.

```css
.wrapper {
    background-color: white;
    display: flex;
    border-radius: 10px;
    flex-direction: row;
    overflow: hidden;
    align-items: center;
    width: 50%;
}

.img-desktop {
    display: block;
    width: 50%;
}


@media (max-width:375px) {
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to create a better responsive website especially the use of CSS Flexbox and Grid. ALso the design principles.
